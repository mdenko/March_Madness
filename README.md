# March_Madness
My predictions for the 2021 March Madness Tournament

## Steps

(1) Used input data from Kaggle competition and created a feature set

(2) Combined Kaggle feature set with scraped Kenpom Data

(3) Trained a Gradient Boosting Algorithm on past tournament results

(4) Used trained model to predict the win probility of each potential game in the 2021 tournament

(5) Plotted results in bracket
