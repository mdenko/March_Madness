# March_Madness
My predictions for the 2021, 2022, and 2023 March Madness Tournament

## 2021 Results

In 2021, I leveraged the kaggle input data and combined with kenpom data. I then applied a Gradient Boosting Classifier and predicted the results.

My resulting bracket was pretty decent. It had an overall log loss 0.66587 of which put me at #503 (out of 707) on the Kaggle March Madness prediction leaderboard.

## 2022 Results

In 2022, I followed a similar method however this time I applied a Gradient Boosting Classifier. My bracket ended up predicting the champion (Kansas) and my braket ended up #143 (out of 930 teams) and a log loss of 0.61624. This was quite a big improvement over previous years, however I think most of this gain is due to predicting the correct champion.
